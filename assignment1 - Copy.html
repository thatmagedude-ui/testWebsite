	<h1>Structure of HTML</h1>
	<p>Your website is made up of many elements. Each element is either inside another element (like how &lt li &gt tags go inside &ltol&gt tags) or after another element (like how this &ltp&gt element is after an &lth1&gt element)
	
	
	<h1>Spacing and Special Characters</h1>
	<p>
	Did you notice how we have angle brackets on the page? We use the & sign for special characters.
	<br>You might also notice that I use the enter key in this code to make it fit my screen. How you space the words does not matter
	look
	this is the same              regardless of how much space you put between words, HTML will shorten it to just 1 space
	</p>

	<h1>Attributes vs CSS Properties</h1>
	<p>Attributes include things like src, id, and href. CSS properties are things like color and font-size. REMEMBER, PROPERTIES ARE NOT ATTRIBUTES. THEY FOLLOW DIFFERENT RULES.</p>

	<h1>What is CSS?</h1>
	<p>
	CSS stands for Cascading <mark>Style</mark> Sheets.<br>
	Cascading because there are levels of specificity. If you have a color defined both inline and embedded,
	the inline styling will decide the color<br>
	Style because we use style properties (NOT ATTRIBUTES) for things like inline and embedded css.<br>
	Sheets because for big projects, your embedded or external stylesheets can take up entire pages to make your website look exactly the way you need it to look.
